> Large language models (LLMs) have recently pushed open-domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever–reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt-level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose **EmbQA**, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

## Installation

We recommend using the provided **sure_retrieval_env.yml** to recreate the exact environment used in our experiments:

```bash
# Recreate the exact environment we used
conda env create -f sure_retrieval_env.yml
conda activate sure_retrieval
```
This ensures full reproducibility of the results reported in our ACL 2025 paper.

💡 Note for users: Our environment file may include extra packages for our internal experiments.
If you prefer a minimal setup, you can create a fresh environment and install only the required packages manually:
```bash
conda create -n EmbQA python=3.11
conda activate EmbQA
```

## Quick Start

Run inference with a single command. Here, we provide our method with LLaMA 3.1 8b Ins Model.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python query_openllm_ourframework_github.py --data_name hotpotqa (2wiki, nq, wq) --qa_data your_dataset_path --lm_type llama3 --n_retrieval 10 --infer_type embqa --output_folder your_output_dataset --end 500 (we follow Implementation of Harsh Trivedi et al. ACL 2023 and Kim et al. ICLR 2024 here) 
```

Since our method needs to insert the exploratory embedding in the model embedding layer, we modify some source code of the llama model in the Decoding directory Decoding/transformers/models/llama/modelling_llama.py, and you need to change the path in the query_openllm_ourframework_github.py at the beginning to your own Decoding directory path.
